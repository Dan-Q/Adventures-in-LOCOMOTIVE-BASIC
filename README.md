# Adventures-in-LOCOMOTIVE-BASIC

A storage for the listings of adventures and OTHER Games I did write or convert for the Amstrad / Schneider CPC classic computers

You may find most of the executables at www.cpcwiki.eu as DSK-images for the common CPC-Emulators of today.

A more detailed (with screenshots) site may be found here: http://www.cpc-power.com/index.php?page=staff&stafftype=1&lenom=Sand-Rabbit-Software

Some more converted games. So much to do but not so much time ...
